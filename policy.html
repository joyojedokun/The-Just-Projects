            <p>
                We may share your information (such as meal or seating preferences and special occasions) with other restaurants in the same restaurant group. This is to enhance the hospitality experience that we (the restaurant group) provide you when you dine with us (such as, trying to seat you by a window, if you previously expressed a preference for window seating) (“customized service”) and to improve our table and shift planning.
                <br>
                <br>
                In addition to providing you with more customized service, we may, as permitted by applicable law, share your information with our restaurant affiliates to support operations, such as to perform analytics, tailor marketing to you, support a loyalty program that you have chosen to participate in, and improve services.
